    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat Sauce</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces hot or sweet Italian turkey sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>12 ounces mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare meat sauce: Heat oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up clumps, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add onions and carrot; cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushroom liquid evaporates, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine, plum tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, oregano, basil, thyme and crushed red pepper. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is very thick, 30 to 45 minutes more. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>To prepare filling & assemble lasagna: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        </ol>
